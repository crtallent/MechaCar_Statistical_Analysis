### Linear Regression to Predict MPG

[summary](https://github.com/crtallent/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Challenge/Images/lm%20sum.png)

In our multiple linear regression results, we see that roughly 71% of our variability can be explained by this linear model.  This indicates that there is a 71% likelihood that this data would represent real-world data points.  The variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the MPG values in the dataset were vehicle_length and ground_clearance, at
