### Linear Regression to Predict MPG

In our [multiple linear regression results](https://github.com/crtallent/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Challenge/Images/lm%20sum.png), we see that roughly 71% of our variability can be explained by this linear model.  This indicates that there is a 71% likelihood that this data would represent real-world data points.  The variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the MPG values in the dataset were vehicle_length and ground_clearance, at 2.60e12 and 5.21e-08, respectively.  The below image shows the detailed results of our multiple linear regression model:
